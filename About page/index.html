                <h3>Laura Tresch
                    <small>founder</small>
                </h3>
                <p>Laura wants to live in a world filled with innovative charities, free travelling and endless opportunities to learn about different cultures and languages.As a linguistic anthropology student with an MA from the University of Oxford in English Linguistics, she has gone down the academic route (for now) and is currently pursuing a Doctorate degree at the University of Bern. She has worked as a teaching assistant in Modern English Linguistics, an English teacher, an English expert for final high school exams, and as a translator. She is well travelled and has recently visited Hong Kong, the Cook Islands, New Zealand and the Philippines (with which she has fallen in love). She is fluent in several languages including Russian, French, German and Italian, and she particularly enjoys reading Russian literature.When sheâ€™s not writing her PhD thesis or teaching, you can find her volunteering in refugees-related charity programmes and taking part in charity runs. Recently she has developed a passion for coding (especially the front-end web design), and she loves photography and playing the harp. You can contact Laura at laura.tresch@we-volunteer.com.</p>
